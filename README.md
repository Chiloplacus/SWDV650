# SWDV650
# Oh hi! Welcome to our project for SWDV650
# This is a cute little IEP Goal Tracker
# So far, all I have up is some outlines for week 1 (login, home page)
# This may seem like a lot of commits, but I think I need to have one for each child issue this week.
# Each of these is linked by the key (SWDV650-22 for example)
# That way, in Jira, we can see what's up :)
# SO lmk how this works, if it's overkill, if it's great and we should party
# Looking forward to the next few weeks!
