# Figma Design Process

Each UI component has a corresponding Figma (.fig) file stored in its own branch.
I have uploaded blank .fig files with connections to this repo in them.

## How to Work with Figma Files:
1. Open the corresponding Figma file from the GitHub branch, labeled with the Jira key.
2. Edit the file as you see fit.
3. Use the GitHub plugin to sync your changes (this is new, it should work)
4. If the plugin does not work, go to the top project ->file->save local copy to get the .fig file
5. Commit updates to GitHub with the Jira issue key
6. Create a pull request when ready for review 
7. Not sure if this last step is necessary, and this whole thing might be overkill :)
